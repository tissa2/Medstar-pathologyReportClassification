In this project, we use an NLP based deep learning model to classify breast pathology reports into benign vs malignant in the first step. In the second step, we build a model that classify benign vs HRL (High Risk Legion) pretrained on  model in step 1. We also also reweighting techniques of the loss function to effectively decrease the false postive rate in step 2.
